         Deferred execution is necessary to change the configuration prior 
         to start the service, which is done during the install instead of running 'net start' at the end. 
         Running 'net start' would not produce any useful log information.

         C# "Immediate custom actions" (*_IMCAC) can get and set msi Properties using the "Session".
             Example: public static ActionResult ReadConfig_IMCAC(Session session)
             Session is a kind of dictionary/hash of msi properties
                  Example: session["MASTER"] = value;
                  Warning: WiX does not check if the property exists. The installer will only break at install time.

         C# "Deferred custom actions" in C# (*_DECAC) require properties to be passed as Session.CustomActionData
         via separate type 51 "custom actions data helper" (_CADH):
           The 'Property=' attribute must be set to the name of the "deferred custom action" (_DECAC) receiving the data, and
           the 'Value=' attribute must be a list of key=[Property] pairs.
               Example: public static ActionResult WriteConfig_DECAC(Session session)
               Example: rootDir = session.CustomActionData["root_dir"]
               Warning: WiX does not check if the key exists. The installer will only break at install time.

         Actions are declared here and called (repeatedly) in Product.wxs.
         Actions must have C# Signature [CustomAction] public static ActionResult
