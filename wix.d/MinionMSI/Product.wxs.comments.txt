		We need a custom action to manipulate a previous NSIS installation.
		This custom action must start before any file operation.
		Catch: the manipulation will essentially uninstall NSIS, but leave the configuration.
		If the installer than fails, this is a catch.

		Attempt 1: FAIL
		  Before='InstallFiles' in InstallExecuteSequence is already too late.

		Attempt 2:
		 Before='LaunchConditions' in 4 sequences.
		 The custom action is named IMCA_PeelNSIS
		 From     http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11668875/execute-a-custom-action-before-product-condition
		   The LaunchConditions action is scheduled to run in both InstallUISequence and InstallExecuteSequence.
		   You must specify such a custom action in both sequences.
		   You should define it with Execute='firstSequence' attribute - this way it will run only the first sequence it is met in.
		 It is defined in wix/MinionMSI/MinionConfigurationExtensionCA.wxs
		 It is coded   in wix/MinionConfigurationExtension/MinionConfiguration.cs

		 From  http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/xsd/wix/launchconditions.html
		   Found two more parent sequences. I add all of them.

		In a /l*v log file, IMCA_PeelNSIS is around line 132, only after actions INSTALL and FindRelatedProducts.
		I have the impression, this is early enough.

		Attempt 3: FAIL
		Are these alternatives?
		  wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/xsd/wix/findrelatedproducts.html    | no because it only modifies the UpgradeTable.
		  wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/xsd/wix/migratefeaturestates.html   | no because NSIS has no feature states
		  wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/xsd/wix/removeexistingproducts.html | no because we must not uninstall NSIS, just peel it.

		Note 1:
		 LaunchConditions seems only to terminate the installer.
